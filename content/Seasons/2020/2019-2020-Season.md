We are pleased to announce the dates for the WRCCDC 2020 season! We wanted to announce these dates early to make sure people had enough time to plan.<!--more-->

Additional trainings may be offered depending on the interest we get. We will be posting an interest form on social media soon to get a better idea of what teams would like to learn for the season. Trainings are all volunteer time, so please help us help you!
