The central registration process for the 2021 CCDC season opens Sept 1, 2020.

<!--more-->

All teams interested in competing in the 2021 CCDC Season must complete the online registration form at https://tinyurl.com/y3xec7eu.  

Registration is open from Sept 1, 2020 through Jan 30th, 2021.  Submitted registrations will be forwarded to the appropriate regional as they are collected.  Registration fees (if any) will be collected by the appropriate region.  Some regions have additional registration procedures your team will need to complete in addition to your central registration.  Please refer to your regional website or contact your regional director for additional information.  Registering does not guarantee a spot in your selected region as some regions have a limited capacity and accept teams on a first come, first served basis.

Please visit the Nation CCDC page for further information: http://nccdc.org/index.php/competition/competitors/registration.
