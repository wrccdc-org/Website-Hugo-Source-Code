You have just been hired as the network and security administrators at a small company and will be taking administrative control of all information systems. You know very little about the network, what security level has been maintained, or what software has been installed. You have one hour to familiarize yourself with the network and systems and to begin the security updates and patches before the red team starts actively attacking your company. In the midst of all the commotion, you have to keep up with the needs of the business and user demands while maintaining service level agreements for all critical Internet services. Welcome to the first day of the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

CCDC is the first competition that specifically focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing "commercial" network infrastructure. Not only do students get a chance to test their knowledge in an operational environment, they will also get a chance to network with industry professionals who are always on the lookout for up and coming engineers. The competition also provides a unique opportunity for students and industry professionals to interact and discuss many of the security and operational challenges the students will soon face as they enter the job market.

Previous competitions have included scenarios such as factories, startup-up companies, defense contractors, theme parks, food production facilities, malware research companies, colleges, cloud providers, and much more. The competition is broken up into two separate events â€“ a (virtual) qualifying round and a final (in person) competition.  Competitors are the top students from the region (Arizona, Nevada, and California).

# Where can I learn more?
The first thing we can recommend is to check with your local college/university/school club directory to see if there is already an established club or organization that is registered for the competition.
