CCDC is the first competition that specifically focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing "commercial" network infrastructure. Not only do students get a chance to test their knowledge in an operational environment, they will also get a chance to network with industry professionals who are always on the lookout for up and coming engineers.

CCDC provides a unique opportunity for students and industry professionals to interact and discuss many of the security and operational challenges the students will soon face as they enter the job market.

If you are a new school that has never competed before, check out the links below, including the rules and FAQ's to see if your team and/or school is eligible to play.
