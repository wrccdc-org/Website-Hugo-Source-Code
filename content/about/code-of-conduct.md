We take our code of conduct very seriously here at WRCCDC. All participants must read this and are expected to follow these guidelines.

<!--more-->
## Overview:
The Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (WRCCDC) provides a competitive space for college students to practice their cyber defense and general information technology (IT) skills against other schools and industry professionals.  This environment can be one of indirect conflict between competitive (Blue) teams and a centralized team of industry professionals. Furthermore, the aspects of competition setup and judging can be one of conflicting viewpoints at times between competitors, coaches, WRCCDC staff and organizers. However, insulting or harassing any participant is unacceptable. We want WRCCDC to be a safe and productive environment for everyone. Itâ€™s not about what you already know or how well you demonstrate your individual abilities. It is how you work as a team, educator, coach, and member of the greater cyber community that matters. It is how you carry yourself and represent your school / organization that matters. 

We do not condone harassment against any participant, for any reason. Harassment includes deliberate intimidation and targeting individuals in a manner that makes them feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or afraid. 

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviours are expected to comply immediately. We reserve the right to respond to harassment in the manner we deem appropriate, including but not limited to expulsion without any refund(s) or expenses related to the competition and (if necessary) referral to the relevant authorities.

This Code of Conduct applies to everyone participating in WRCCDC - from student competitors, coaches, operations, judging, support staff and administrators and faculty of the hosting institution (Coastline College). This will also include any spectators for both virtual and in-person events. 

Anyone can report harassment. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, you can contact any WRCCDC staff member, Coastline Administrator, Faculty or Staff member. They will bring this to the attention of the Director of WRCCD for action.

WRCCDC / Coastline staff will be happy to help participants contact campus security, local law enforcement, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any and all WRCCDC events.

**Remember: The Competition is what you make of it, and as a community we can create a great experience for all involved.**

## Rules:
All competitors will adhere to the National CCDC (NCCDC) and WRCCDC rules. Any violations will be brought to the attention of the Director, Site Judge, or Chief Judge immediately for investigation.
