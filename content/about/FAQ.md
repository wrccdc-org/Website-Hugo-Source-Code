## How Long is WRCCDC?
WRCCDC _(Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition)_ is a __two day__ competition event.

## What is the competition like?
You have just been hired as the network and security administrators at a small company and will be taking administrative control of all information systems. You know very little about the network, what security level has been maintained, or what software has been installed. You have one hour to familiarize yourself with the network and systems and to begin the security updates and patches before the red team starts actively attacking your company. In the midst of all the commotion, you have to keep up with the needs of the business and user demands while maintaining service level agreements for all critical Internet services. Welcome to the first day of the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).

## What are some the previous year's scenarios?
Previous competitions have included scenarios such as factories, startup-up companies, defense contractors, theme parks, food production facilities, malware research companies, colleges, cloud providers, and much more.

## What is white/black/orange/etc.. team?
Throughout the competition the following teams exist and competitors will interact with:

* **Gold Team/Operations Team** - competition officials that organize, run, and manage the competition.
* **White Team** - competition officials that observe team performance in their competition area and evaluate team performance and rule compliance.
* **Red Team** - penetration testing professionals simulating external hackers attempting to gain unauthorized access to competition teams’ systems.
* **Black Team** - competition support members that design the competition and provide technical support during events.
* **Orange Team** - competition officials in charge of manual testing of services, content, & functionality.
* **Blue Team/Competition Team** - the institution competitive teams consisting of students competing in a CCDC event. (aka: Competitors)
* **Team Captain** - a student member of the Blue Team identified as the primary liaison between the Blue Team and the White Team.
* **Team Co-Captain** - a student member of the Blue Team identified as the secondary or backup liaison between the Blue Team and the White Team, should the Team Captain be unavailable (i.e. not in the competition room).
* **Team Representatives** - a faculty or staff representative of the Blue Team’s host institution responsible for serving as a liaison between competition officials and the Blue Team’s institution. (aka: coach or school rep).

## Are there other regions?
Yes. The entirety of CCDC is split into 10 regions. We are the Western Regional. Each region sends their first place winners to compete at Nationals, where each team battles it out for champion. Due to the number of universities and colleges that get to participate, each region may operate differently in terms of how they get to select which teams get to compete at their regional.

## Who can participate?
Competitors are College and University students from Arizona, Nevada, and California. If you are not from these states, then we recommend you look into the other CCDC regions.

## What is the typical structure of the competition season?
For us, we hold multiple, online, introductory rounds to allow new and returning teams to *"test the waters"*. We call these the **Invitationals**. Once the Invitationals are over, we hold an online qualifying round known as **Qualifiers** where we filter out the 10 best teams that will eventually compete at our in-person, real-time, regional round known as **Regionals**. Due to the number of schools that participate in our region, as well as the capacity of our IT infrastructure, we implemented this qualifying round to make everyone's experience as fair and enjoyable as possible. The first place winners at Regionals get sent to compete at **Nationals**.
<br>**TL;DR: Invitationals > Qualifiers > Western Regionals > Nationals.**
