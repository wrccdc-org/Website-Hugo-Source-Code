Since the Western Regional of CCDC covers a large region of schools, we host multiple, invitationals each year to give many schools the opportunity to participate in the competition. <!--more-->In order to be fair and have the best competition as possible, the top 8 teams from the qualifier move on to compete in person at the Regional, where the 1st place winner moves onward to Nationals.

## D2 (Virtual)
For teams who wish to build up skills in cyber-security and defense we offer a competition tailored to community colleges and Freshman/Sophomore teams. Schools who participate in Division 2 may be on other regions, and participate for $100.

## Invitationals (Virtual)
One benefit of invitationals is exposing teams to how CCDC events are run. Another is testing connectivity for the virtual qualifying event. However, the primary benefit is the experience developed from the team work, the challenges and honing the skills to be successful in cyber security.

For the past few years WRCCDC held 3 invitationals each year. Some events have Red Team activity, though not all.  

Invitationals are considered “pick up” games - few rules apply and all are welcome to participate allowing mentors to coach and new comers to learn. There is no limit on how many can take part in the invitational, unlike official competitions which require full time students.
However, here the few that apply:

  * Only teams from Nevada, Arizona or California are eligible to participate in WR events.
  * Only 1 team per university or college is allowed.​

That's it!  For questions about the invitationals or any WRCCDC event contact the organizers at: organizers@wrccdc.org.

## Qualifiers (Virtual)                                                       
Every team that is registered to compete in WRCCDC is welcome to participate in the online Qualifier, however, only the top 8 teams from the WRCCDC Qualifier make it to the in-person regional.​ This is considered a full competition, and all participating teams must have a remote site judge. Events usually take place over the course of one day and winners announced soon after.
​
## Regionals (In-Person)
The Regional is a multiple day event and is held in person, unlike the Qualifiers and Invitationals. In the Regionals, the top 8 qualifying teams will experience 2 days of maintaining and hardening systems, complying with management's demands, providing customer & client support, along with the sneaky and devious attacks by Red Team. Only the top winning team gets to move on to compete at National CCDC.
